# Social-Media RESTful API Group Project

## Overview

Collaborated with other developers to create a RESTful API using Spring Boot, JPA, and Postgresql that exposes operations for social media data that resembles the conceptual model of Twitter.


In this collaborative effort, our team worked on implementing a RESTful API that draws inspiration from the conceptual model of Twitter. Leveraging tools such as Spring Boot, JPA, and PostgreSQL, we transformed the provided specifications into a working model. While the project required collective input, my specific contributions revolved around handling requests with Spring services and controllers, implementing validation and business logic, and managing data transformation between the API and database models.

## Utilizing the Provided Test Suite

Our team was provided with a comprehensive test suite to validate the correctness and robustness of our API. We integrated Postman's newman CLI, which I assisted in setting up via `npm install -g newman`. With everything in place, we diligently ran the tests using the `newman` command. Through our combined efforts, and iterative troubleshooting, we celebrated the moment when all 330 assertions successfully passed.

## Working with the Requirements

We were handed a thorough set of requirements that outlined the roadmap for our project. These requirements covered a wide range of topics, including RESTful Endpoint Methods and URLs, URL Variables, Types, and Object Properties, among others. While we did not author these guidelines, their depth and clarity were instrumental in shaping our approach and ensuring our API endpoints aligned with the expected structure and behavior.

## Personal Reflection

Being part of this group project was an enlightening journey. Navigating the challenges of collaborative development, leveraging provided resources, and converging on a unified solution was truly rewarding. This experience underscored the value of teamwork and offered me an opportunity to expand my backend development skillset within a dynamic and supportive environment.
